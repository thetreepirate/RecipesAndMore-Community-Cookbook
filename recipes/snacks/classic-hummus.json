      "1 can (15 oz) chickpeas, drained and rinsed",
      "1/4 cup tahini",
      "2 cloves garlic",
      "3 tablespoons lemon juice",

    "instructions": "1. Reserve a few chickpeas for garnish. Add remaining chickpeas to food processor.\n\n2. Add tahini, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, cumin, and salt.\n\n3. Blend for 1 minute until smooth and creamy.\n\n4. With processor running, slowly add water 1 tablespoon at a time until you reach desired consistency. Hummus should be smooth and spreadable.\n\n5. Taste and adjust seasonings. Want more lemon? Garlic? Salt? Add it!\n\n6. Transfer to serving bowl. Create a well in the center with the back of a spoon.\n\n7. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with paprika. Top with reserved chickpeas and parsley.\n\n8. Serve with pita bread, vegetables, or crackers. Store in airtight container in fridge for up to 1 week.",

    "notes": "For extra-smooth hummus, peel the chickpeas (yes, it's tedious but worth it!). Don't have tahini? Substitute with peanut butter or almond butter. For garlic lovers, roast the garlic first for a milder, sweeter flavor.",
